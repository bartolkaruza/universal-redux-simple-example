# universal-redux-simple-example
Simplified example project for the [universal-redux npm module](https://github.com/bdefore/universal-redux)

This project contains the bare minimum setup for a React + Redux universal app, including all necessary build tooling to get started.

The intention of this project is that a new react project started by copying this project feels like a clean slate. You only have to add your specific implementations to start creating a web application. 

There is no examples of implementations or best practices through these examples available. If you want to see what a full fledged React + Redux project looks like, I recommend having a look at [react-redux-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example). The project at that link is the basis for the universal-redux npm module.
